I've recently set up a personal second brain of sort, built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) and [Contentlayer](https://contentlayer.dev). I haven't thought up of an unique enough name for it, but I've called it memx for now because it sounds like [Memex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memex).

If you come up with a good name please DM me on Discord or smth: 
Contacts are at the bottom of1 my portfolio linked in the Navbar.
